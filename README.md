# css-color-tester

With this you'll be able to test if a particular text color works on a chosen background color.

Choose the text and the background color, and press the Change Colors! button. This will change the named colors on the page, as well as the colors of the preview.

If the combination works, choose Works, otherwise choose Doesn't work. By doing so, you'll change the header text accordingly.
